accesspopup
	ver 0.8-6 12 Jul 2024
		Some users reporting that while using a phone, they are unable to connect to the AP running on a RaspberryPi Zero W with PiOS Bookworm 32bit. Removing the AccessPopup profiles security group and strict encryption references from the 
		config file solves the issue. These are automatically set by nmcli on creation of the profile in addition to how the Network Manager GUI creates the profile.
		This issue only affected the PizeroW. The PiZero2 and Pi3/3B+ did not have an issue.
	ver 0.8-5 27 Mar 2024
